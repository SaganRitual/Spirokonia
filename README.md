Explorations in spirograph simulations

Inspired by YouTuber Sort of School's #SoME1 [video](https://youtu.be/n-e9C8g5x68)

# Instructions

* Clone
* Build one of the Spirokonia targets. The other targets are for developing new components
* Prefer iPad in landscape orientation. It runs on iPhone and macOS too, but I haven't spent any time making it look non-weird on them yet.
* Play with the buttons, I think they're mostly intuitive, except:
  * Long-press on a not-already-selected ring selector to solo-select that ring
  * Long-press on a solo-selected ring selector to select all
  * Density shows a floating-point value but internally I'm only doing integer density for now
* Enjoy
