A toy, a virtual "spirograph", inspired by YouTuber Sort of School's #SoME1 [video](https://youtu.be/n-e9C8g5x68), which was inspired by YouTuber 3Blue1Brown's #SoME1 [challenge](https://youtu.be/ojjzXyQCzso).

Set the number of spinning spheres and their speed, color density and length of display for a zen like visual experience.

# Installation

Requirements:

- MacOS Monterey V12.1
- Xcod V13.2.1

* Clone the project
* Double-click the Spirokonia.xcsworkspace file to open in Xcode
* Propeller+b to build and then click the Run icon in Xcod
* Build one of the Spirokonia targets. The other targets are for developing new components. (DAB note: I'm not sure what it means to "build one of the Spirokonia targets" -- is this describing what is detailed in the bullet point just below?)
* Prefer the iPad target in landscape orientation or the macOS target. It does run on iPhone, but I haven't yet figured out a user-friendly way to present the views. (DAB note: direct the user to where you select the ipad target and and landscape orientation in xcode)


# How to use the controls -- coming soon

The SpiroZen controls are located in the left-side control panel and allow you to set the number of spheres that display, their speed, color density, and color display to your liking.

The outtermost blue sphere's controls can be configured using the Main controls. Use the Tumblers controls to configure the four other spheres (purple, red, yellow, and green spheres) that spin within the outermost blue sphere.
